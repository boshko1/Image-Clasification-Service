# Image-Clasification-Service

Image Classification Service (ICS) allows the user to submit an image's URL and get the contents of the image (displayed as tags) with the corresponding confidence. To do this, the service relies on an online image recognition service. 

The back-end was implemented using Spring Boot and the front end was made with Angular framework. The service requires a local database.
